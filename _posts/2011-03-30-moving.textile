Hey, just wanted to let the world know that I'm currently attempting to coordinate an interprovincial move with my girlfriend, as well as an extended vacation (approximately 3 to 4 weeks). I'll have my netbook with me during this time, so I won't be totally off the grid, but just be aware that I'm busy as hell and don't always have time to reply to every email immediately.
