I had a bit of time today to scan the 5x7 prints that I shot with my Burke & James Rembrandt a couple weeks ago. I "put up a new gallery":/rembrandt/ for the scans. The photos were created by loading Ilford MG IV *paper* (not negs) directly into the camera. Because of this, all the images are mirrored left-right and inverted dark-light. Because Ilford MG IV paper is estimated to have an ISO rating of 6, I metered the scene with my Nikon D200 and then compensated for the low ISO in my head.

I had so much fun taking these photos! There's a certain thrill to developing photos by hand in your bathroom that's totally lacking from the modern digital workflow that we've all become accustomed to.

I have a couple more yet to scan, so check back tomorrow for those as well.
