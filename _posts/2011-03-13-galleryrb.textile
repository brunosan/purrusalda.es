Today, I spent at least three hours trudging through snow with my "Rembrandt":http://aggregator.files.wordpress.com/2008/11/the-photographer.jpg. I only have five holsters for the thing, which means all that effort was just to take ten pictures. I've got my fingers crossed that any of them even turn out! Hopefully there'll be enough time to develop these tomorrow, sometime between picking my girlfriend up from the Greyhound station and cooking her dinner. 

On a completely unrelated note, my enthusiasm for the new jekyll blagging system was so great that I decided to write a plugin that automates the creation of the image galleries on this site. In the process, I created something that is more than just a tool to publish stylish image galleries, but is more generally useful for automatically creating lists of any type of file. It can come in handy if you have a frequently changing list of downloads on your website. You can see the result of that work at "my private jekyll fork":https://github.com/robru/jekyll and also read about "my efforts to have this included in the next version of jekyll":https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/pull/295. Maybe you should try it out! You could even let me know what you think about it, what you liked, what you'd change, etc. Cheers!
